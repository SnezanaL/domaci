/**
 * 01 easy
 * Crate an array named myLuckyNumbers with the following numbers: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10
 * Create a program that sums all the numbers of the array
 */

/**
 * 02 easy
 * Write a program that given 2 values prints these values in an array.
 * Example: with 5,9 should print the array [5, 9]
 */

/**
 * 03 easy
 * Write a program that given an array prints the first element of the array.
 * Example: from array [1, 2] should print 1
 */

/**
 * 04 easy
 * Write a program with given an array and a variable and
 * set the first element of the array with the variable and print the array
 */

/**
 * 05 easy
 * Write a program that prints the last element of a given array
 */

/**
 * 06 easy
 * Write a program with given an array and a variable. The program should
 * add the variable to the end of the array and then print the array
 */

/**
 * 07 easy - medium
 * Write a program that adds an element to the end of an array.
 * However, the element should only be added if it is not already in the array.
 * Example: In array [1, 2] 3 could be added and become [1, 2, 3] and 2 should not be added.
 * Print the array at the end
 */

/**
 * 08 medium
 * Write a program that prints a string from an array of words
 * by concatenating the words in the array, separated by commas and - the last word - by an 'and'.
 * Example: ['Huey', 'Dewey', 'Louie'] should print 'Huey, Dewey and Louie'
 */

/**
 * 09 easy
 * Write a program to print the X first elements of an array.
 * Example: from array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] the program should be able to print the first 5 [1, 2, 3, 4 , 5]
 */

/**
 * 10 medium
 * Write a program with given a string of digits and inserts dashes (-)
 * between each two even numbers.
 * For example if the string is 025468 the output should be 0-254-6-8
 * The program should print the string output
 */

/**
 * 11 medium
 * Write a program which has an array and strips from it all items that begin from 'a'
 * E.g. the array ['banana','orange', 'apple'] should become ['banana','orange']
