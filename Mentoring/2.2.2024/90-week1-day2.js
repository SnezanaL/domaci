/**
 * Exercise 01
 *
 * Write a program that has string which contains a filename
 * and prints to the console the extension of that filename
 *
 * Example: for filename 'file.txt' should print 'txt'
 *
 */

/**
 * Exercise 02
 * Write a program that prints a random integer between 1 and 100.
 */

/**
 * Exercise 03
 * Write a program that rounds a given decimal number to the nearest whole number.
 * For example, given 7.6, the program should print 8.
 */

/**
 * Exercise 04
 * Write a program that takes two integers and prints the remainder of the first number divided by the second number.
 */

/**
 *  Exercise 05
 *  Write a program that has 2 numbers and checks whether both numbers are
 *  in the range 40..60 or in the range 70..100 inclusive and prints the result.
 */

/**
 * Exercise 06
 * Write a program that computes the difference between a specified number and 19.
 * It should print their difference if the number is less than 19
 * and triple their absolute difference if the specified number is greater than 19
 *
 * e.g. if the number is 20, then it should print 3 and if it is 10, it should print 9.
 */

/**
 * Exercise 07
 * Write a program to check two given numbers
 * and print true if one of the numbers is 50 or if their sum is 50
 */

/**
 * Exercise 08
 * Write a program to check two given integers
 * and print 'Yes' if one is positive and another one is negative
 * or 'No' if both are positive/negative
 */

/**
 * Exercise 09
 * Write a program that prints a given string.
 * If the given string begins with "Py" then print the original string.
 * Else print the string adding "Py" in front of it.
 */

/**
 * Exercise 10
 * Write a program to create a new string from a given string taking the last 3 characters
 * and added at both the front and back.
 * The string length must be 3 or more
 */

/**
 * Exercise 11 - could be challenging
 * Write a program that checks whether the last digit of three given positive integers
 * is the same
 *
 * e.g. the last digit of 41, 31 and 51 is the same
